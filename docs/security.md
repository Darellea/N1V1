# N1V1 Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security model, practices, and compliance measures implemented in the N1V1 trading framework. The framework is designed to meet institutional-grade security requirements with formal verification, secure key management, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Security Model

### Core Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for all components
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure behavior by default
4. **Auditability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
5. **Compliance**: Regulatory and industry standard compliance

### Architecture Security

#### Key Management
- **Primary**: HashiCorp Vault integration for production environments
- **Secondary**: AWS KMS support for cloud-native deployments
- **Fallback**: Encrypted local storage with automatic key rotation
- **Rotation**: Automatic key rotation every 90 days (configurable)

#### Credential Management
- Centralized credential management with audit logging
- Secure secret fetching via `get_secret()` helper functions
- Environment variable fallback for development mode only
- Secure credential masking in logs and error messages
- Access pattern monitoring and alerting
- Production secrets stored in Vault/KMS, never in .env files

#### Network Security
- Encrypted communication channels (TLS 1.3+)
- API rate limiting and abuse detection
- Geographic access restrictions (configurable)
- DDoS protection integration

## Order Flow Security

### Formal Verification

#### Schema Validation
All orders undergo strict schema validation before execution:

```python
required_fields = ["id", "symbol", "side", "type", "amount"]
# Additional validation for numeric fields, order ID format, etc.
```

#### Invariant Checks
- **Order ID Uniqueness**: Prevents duplicate order processing
- **State Consistency**: Ensures valid state transitions (pending â†’ filled/cancelled/rejected)
- **Amount Validation**: Positive numeric values only
- **Symbol Format**: Valid trading pair formats

#### Rate Limiting
- Per-symbol rate limits (configurable, default: 10 orders/minute)
- Burst protection with exponential backoff
- Automatic cooldown periods for violations

### Security Monitoring

#### Real-time Alerts
- Security violation detection
- Invalid order schema alerts
- Duplicate order ID detection
- Rate limit violations
- Unauthorized access attempts

#### Audit Logging
- All credential access logged with timestamps
- Order lifecycle events tracked
- Security events categorized by severity
- Compliance-ready audit trails

## Compliance Framework

### Regulatory Compliance

#### Data Protection
- **GDPR**: Personal data handling and consent management
- **SOX**: Financial reporting and audit trail requirements
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry standards (if applicable)

#### Industry Standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management guidelines
- **OWASP**: Web application security standards

### Audit Readiness

#### Automated Compliance Checks
- Daily security health checks
- Monthly compliance report generation
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Configuration drift detection

#### Documentation Requirements
- Security control documentation
- Incident response procedures
- Change management records
- Access control matrices

## Key Management

### Vault Integration

#### Configuration
```json
{
  "security": {
    "vault": {
      "enabled": true,
      "url": "https://vault.example.com:8200",
      "token": "${VAULT_TOKEN}",
      "mount_point": "secret",
      "tls_verify": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Features
- Automatic token renewal
- Secret versioning and rollback
- Access policy enforcement
- Audit logging integration

### AWS KMS Integration

#### Configuration
```json
{
  "security": {
    "kms": {
      "enabled": true,
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "profile": "n1v1-production",
      "key_alias": "n1v1-trading-key"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Features
- Cloud-native key management
- Automatic key rotation
- Cross-region replication
- CloudTrail integration

### Local Key Management

#### Configuration
```json
{
  "security": {
    "local": {
      "enabled": true,
      "key_rotation_days": 90,
      "encryption_algorithm": "AES-256-GCM",
      "backup_enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Secret Management Flow

#### Development vs Production

**Development Mode (ENV=dev):**
- Secrets loaded from environment variables (`.env` file)
- Fallback mechanism for local development
- No secure storage required

**Production Mode (ENV=live/production):**
- Secrets fetched from Vault/KMS only
- `.env` files deprecated and ignored
- Missing secrets cause system failure with clear error messages

#### Secret Fetching API

The framework provides secure helper functions for retrieving secrets:

```python
from utils.security import get_secret, rotate_key

# Get exchange API key
api_key = await get_secret("exchange_api_key")

# Get Discord bot token
discord_token = await get_secret("discord_token")

# Rotate a key
success = await rotate_key("exchange_api_key")
```

#### Supported Secrets
- `exchange_api_key`: Exchange API key
- `exchange_api_secret`: Exchange API secret
- `exchange_api_passphrase`: Exchange API passphrase
- `discord_token`: Discord bot token
- `discord_channel_id`: Discord channel ID
- `discord_webhook_url`: Discord webhook URL
- `api_key`: Web API key

### Key Rotation Procedures

#### Automatic Rotation
- Keys are rotated automatically every 90 days (configurable)
- Old keys are invalidated immediately after rotation
- New keys are applied seamlessly without service interruption

#### Manual Rotation
```python
# Rotate exchange API key
success = await rotate_key("exchange_api_key")
if success:
    # Update exchange configuration
    new_key = await get_secret("exchange_api_key")
    exchange_client.update_credentials(new_key)
```

#### Rotation Policies
- **Exchange Keys**: Rotate every 90 days, limited to trade/read scopes only
- **Discord Tokens**: Rotate every 90 days, minimal permissions (bot, webhook)
- **API Keys**: Rotate every 30 days, scoped to necessary endpoints only

#### Least Privilege Enforcement
- Exchange API keys: Read-only access for market data, trade execution only
- Discord tokens: Bot permissions limited to required channels and actions
- Database credentials: Read/write access restricted to necessary tables
- Cloud service accounts: Minimal IAM permissions for required operations
