# API Audit Report

## Overview
This report contains findings from a comprehensive audit of the `api/` folder, focusing on security, performance, maintainability, and API contract consistency.

## Findings

### Security Issues

#### 1. CORS Configuration Allows All Origins
- **Category**: Security
- **Description**: The CORS middleware is configured to allow all origins ("*"), which can expose the API to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and other cross-origin vulnerabilities.
- **Location**: `api/app.py`, lines 58-62
- **Suggested Fix**: Replace wildcard origins with specific allowed domains, or implement proper CORS policy based on environment.

#### 2. Inconsistent API Key Authentication
- **Category**: Security
- **Description**: Some endpoints use `optional_api_key` dependency while others use `verify_api_key`, creating inconsistent authentication enforcement that could lead to unauthorized access.
- **Location**: `api/app.py`, endpoints like `/orders` (optional) vs `/pause` (required)
- **Suggested Fix**: Standardize authentication requirements across all sensitive endpoints. Use required authentication for all endpoints that modify state or access sensitive data.

#### 3. Missing Input Validation
- **Category**: Security
- **Description**: API endpoints lack input validation and sanitization, making them vulnerable to injection attacks and malformed data.
- **Location**: `api/app.py`, all endpoint functions
- **Suggested Fix**: Implement Pydantic request models for all endpoints that accept parameters, and add validation decorators.

#### 4. Potential Information Disclosure in Error Messages
- **Category**: Security
- **Description**: Error messages may expose internal system details, database schemas, or stack traces that could aid attackers.
- **Location**: `api/app.py`, global exception handler (lines 246-258)
- **Suggested Fix**: Sanitize error messages in production, log detailed errors internally but return generic messages to clients.

#### 5. No Input Validation on Database Models
- **Category**: Security
- **Description**: SQLAlchemy models lack validation constraints, allowing potentially malicious or invalid data to be stored.
- **Location**: `api/models.py`, all model classes
- **Suggested Fix**: Add validation constraints to model fields (e.g., length limits, type checks) and implement pre-save validation.

### Performance Issues

#### 6. Hardcoded Rate Limiting Values
- **Category**: Performance
- **Description**: Rate limits are hardcoded (60/minute) and cannot be adjusted without code changes.
- **Location**: `api/app.py`, lines 95-96
- **Suggested Fix**: Make rate limits configurable via environment variables or configuration files.

#### 7. SQLite Threading Configuration Issues
- **Category**: Performance

# Backtest Folder Audit Report â€“ 9/16/2025

## Overview
This report contains findings from a comprehensive audit of the `backtest/` folder, focusing on security, algorithmic correctness, performance, maintainability, and error handling. The folder contains one file: `backtester.py`, which provides utilities for exporting equity progression, computing backtest metrics, and handling regime-aware backtesting.

## Findings

### Security Issues

#### 1. Lack of Input Validation on Data Structures
- **Category**: Security
- **Description**: Functions accept `equity_progression` and other data structures without validating their contents, potentially allowing malformed or malicious data to cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, functions like `compute_backtest_metrics`, `export_equity_progression`, `compute_regime_aware_metrics`
- **Suggested Fix**: Add input validation using type hints and runtime checks to ensure data structures contain expected keys and types.

#### 2. File Path Injection Risk
- **Category**: Security
- **Description**: Output paths are constructed using `os.path.join` but not validated, potentially allowing path traversal attacks if user-controlled input is passed.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, `_ensure_results_dir` and various export functions
- **Suggested Fix**: Sanitize and validate output paths, restrict to allowed directories, and use absolute paths where possible.

#### 3. Exception Handling May Mask Security Issues
- **Category**: Security
- **Description**: Broad `except Exception` blocks catch all exceptions, potentially hiding security-related errors like file access violations or data corruption.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, lines 89-91, 103-105, 117-119, etc.
- **Suggested Fix**: Use specific exception types and log security-relevant exceptions separately.

### Algorithmic Issues

#### 4. Potential Division by Zero in Return Calculations
- **Category**: Algorithmic
- **Description**: When calculating percentage returns, if `prev` equity is zero, the code appends 0.0, but this may not accurately represent the scenario and could mask data issues.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, lines 113-118 in `_compute_for_records`
- **Suggested Fix**: Add logging for zero equity values and consider alternative handling, such as skipping the calculation or using a special value.

#### 5. Sharpe Ratio Calculation Edge Cases
- **Category**: Algorithmic
- **Description**: Sharpe ratio uses `stdev(returns)` but doesn't handle cases where returns list is empty or contains constant values beyond the existing check.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, lines 127-133
- **Suggested Fix**: Ensure `returns` list has sufficient data points (e.g., minimum 2) before calculating standard deviation.

#### 6. Profit Factor Infinity Handling
- **Category**: Algorithmic
- **Description**: Profit factor can be `float("inf")` when gross_loss is zero but gross_profit is positive, which may cause issues in downstream calculations.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, lines 137-143
- **Suggested Fix**: Cap profit factor at a reasonable maximum value or handle infinity cases explicitly in dependent calculations.

### Performance Issues

- **Category**: Performance
- **Description**: Multiple list comprehensions are used within loops for calculations like wins/losses, which could be optimized for large datasets.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, lines 147-152, 155-160
- **Suggested Fix**: Pre-compute aggregated values or use more efficient iteration patterns for large equity progressions.

#### 8. Redundant Computations in Per-Symbol Metrics
- **Category**: Performance
- **Description**: When computing per-symbol metrics, the code groups data and recomputes metrics for each symbol, potentially duplicating work if symbols overlap.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, lines 185-195
- **Suggested Fix**: Optimize grouping and computation to avoid redundant calculations.

#### 9. Synchronous File I/O Operations
- **Category**: Performance
- **Description**: All file operations are synchronous, which could block in high-throughput scenarios.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, all `open()` calls
- **Suggested Fix**: Consider asynchronous file operations or use a thread pool for I/O operations.

### Maintainability Issues

#### 10. Long Functions with Multiple Responsibilities

- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, `compute_backtest_metrics` (lines 75-200), `compute_regime_aware_metrics` (lines 350-420)
- **Suggested Fix**: Break down into smaller, focused functions with single responsibilities.

#### 11. Hardcoded Constants and Paths
- **Category**: Maintainability
- **Description**: Default paths like "results/equity_curve.csv" and constants like 252 for Sharpe ratio are hardcoded, making the code inflexible.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, various function defaults
- **Suggested Fix**: Move constants to a configuration module and make paths configurable.

#### 12. Inconsistent Error Handling Patterns
- **Category**: Maintainability
- **Description**: Error handling varies across functions - some use try-except with generic fallbacks, others don't handle errors at all.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, throughout
- **Suggested Fix**: Standardize error handling with a consistent pattern, including logging and appropriate fallbacks.

#### 13. Missing Type Hints in Some Areas
- **Category**: Maintainability
- **Description**: While most functions have type hints, some internal variables and complex data structures lack proper typing.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, internal variables in functions
- **Suggested Fix**: Add comprehensive type hints for all variables and return types.

### Error Handling Gaps

#### 14. Silent Failures in Data Processing
- **Category**: Error Handling
- **Description**: When processing equity data, exceptions are caught and values set to defaults (0.0), which may hide data quality issues.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, lines 89-91, 103-105
- **Suggested Fix**: Log warnings for data conversion failures and consider raising exceptions for critical data issues.

#### 15. No Validation of Regime Data Alignment
- **Category**: Error Handling
- **Description**: In `compute_regime_aware_metrics`, regime_data length is assumed to match equity_progression, but no validation ensures this.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, lines 365-375
- **Suggested Fix**: Add length validation and handle mismatches gracefully.

#### 16. Missing Logging for Critical Operations
- **Category**: Error Handling
- **Description**: No logging is implemented for file operations, calculations, or errors, making debugging difficult.
- **Location**: `backtest/backtester.py`, throughout
