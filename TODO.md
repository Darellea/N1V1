# AI Code Refactor Task - Portfolio Manager

## Task Overview
Refactor large methods in `portfolio/portfolio_manager.py` to improve maintainability, readability, and adherence to SRP.

## Guidelines
- No method should exceed 50 lines
- Each method should have a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into utilities or private helpers
- Preserve external interfaces
- Add docstrings and type hints

## Todo List
- [x] Create a comprehensive todo list for the refactoring task
- [x] Read and analyze the portfolio_manager.py file
- [x] Identify methods exceeding 50 lines
- [x] Refactor long methods following SRP and other guidelines
- [x] Add docstrings and type hints to refactored methods
- [x] Show before vs after refactor for changed methods
- [x] Explain improvements made

## Refactoring Summary

### Methods Refactored

1. **`get_portfolio_metrics`** (57 lines → 25 lines)
   - **Before**: Single method calculating all metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate)
   - **After**: Split into 4 methods:
     - `get_portfolio_metrics` (main method, 25 lines)
     - `_calculate_sharpe_ratio` (8 lines)
     - `_calculate_max_drawdown` (9 lines)
     - `_calculate_win_rate` (5 lines)

2. **`rebalance`** (56 lines → 25 lines)
   - **Before**: Single method handling rebalancing logic, validation, trade execution, and history updates
   - **After**: Split into 4 methods:
     - `rebalance` (main method, 25 lines)
     - `_check_rebalance_needed` (18 lines)
     - `_update_allocation_history` (8 lines)
     - Maintained existing helper methods for threshold/periodic checks

### Improvements Made

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - Each method now has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Complex calculations are separated into focused helper methods
   - Validation logic is separated from execution logic

2. **Readability & Maintainability**:
   - Methods are now shorter and easier to understand
   - Logic flow is clearer with method names describing their purpose
   - Reduced cognitive load when reviewing or modifying code

3. **Reusability**:
   - Helper methods like `_calculate_sharpe_ratio` can be reused elsewhere
   - Validation logic is now testable independently
   - Calculation methods can be easily extended or modified

4. **Consistency**:
   - All refactored methods include proper docstrings
   - Type hints are maintained throughout
   - Method naming follows consistent private helper convention

### Before vs After Comparison

#### `get_portfolio_metrics` Method
**Before (57 lines)**:
- Combined calculation of all metrics in one method
- Complex nested logic for different calculations
- Difficult to test individual components

**After (25 lines)**:
- Main method orchestrates metric collection
- Each metric calculation is in a separate method
- Clear separation of concerns

#### `rebalance` Method
**Before (56 lines)**:
- Single method handling validation, calculation, execution, and history
- Mixed responsibilities made the method hard to follow
- Error handling was embedded throughout

**After (25 lines)**:
- Clear separation between validation, execution, and history updates
- Each helper method handles one aspect of rebalancing
- Easier to modify individual components without affecting others
